# Grid Pathfinding 

## Description

This project is a small demo of pathfinding algorithms in a grid medium. The project is a work in progress and is being developed as a hobby project. The project is developed in C++ and uses the SFML library for the graphics.

## How to run

The project uses the SFML library, so you need to have it installed in your system. The project is only tested in Linux. 

The project uses CMake, use the run.sh script to compile and run the project.

```bash
./run.sh
```

## Roadmap

- [x] Refactor and clean the code.
- [x] Make the grid show.
- [ ] Create interface for showing the search algorithm results
- [ ] Implement common alogrithms
    - [ ] Implement A* algorithm
    - [ ] Implement Dijkstra algorithm
    - [ ] Implement Breadth First S algorithm
    - [ ] Implement Depth First Search algorithm
